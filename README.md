# IntelliSenseKnowledgeGraph

## Description

A neuro-symbolic reasoning framework integrating probabilistic graphical models with differentiable logic programming, enabling hierarchical reasoning and uncertainty quantification in large-scale knowledge graphs.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a software project about IntelliSenseKnowledgeGraph:
- "Constructs a semantic knowledge graph from unstructured data using natural language processing and entity disambiguation",
- "Provides realtime entity resolution and linking across multiple data sources using fuzzy matching and machine learning",
- "Supports ontologybased reasoning and inference using description logics and rulebased systems",
- "Includes a robust entity disambiguation module utilizing contextual information and knowledge graph embeddings",
- "Offers a scalable graph database with optimized query performance for complex knowledge graph traversals",
- "Enables knowledge graph visualization and exploration through interactive graph rendering and filtering",
- "Integrates with popular AI and machine learning frameworks for seamless model integration and deployment"
- Let me know if you need any changes!
